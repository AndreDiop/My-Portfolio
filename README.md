# Welcome

My personal portfolio build with React and features a nes.css framework and css3 for the front end design. 
The design was inspired by early nintendo games and callsback to an early 90's aethetic and upon discovering the nes.css, I knew it
would be the perfect framework to bring my vision to life.
